The variables in the data file are extracted from the dataset availaible at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
A complete description of this initial dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The training and test sets are merged (first: training, second: test) and treated together.

Only the mean and std variables are extracted from the initial dataset. The list of the variable names is given at the end of this file.

Observations are grouped by activity and subject number. The header of the data file gives the description of each group (e.g. "WALKING.1" correspond to the subjet 1 who is walking).
